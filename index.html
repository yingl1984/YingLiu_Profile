              <div class="item-double">
                <p>The development of the computer industry has never stopped, and neither have I. During the past 3 years, I've been deep diving into learning full stack development using the forefront of the web development technique, to keep refreshing my knowledge base. I enjoy building the website and sharing it with people all over the world. During the product life cycle, I've been a QA tech lead, a project manager, a scrum master, a level3 customer support to handle the tickets directly from customers. But the role I want to be most is the person who contributes the code directly to the product, a software developer.</p>
                <p>If you want to hire a passionate, hardworking, innovative developer who knows the overall product development lifecycle, please reach out.</p>
                <p>Looking forward to joining your team, and collaborating with other developers to create excellent products.</p>
                <p>My hobbies:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>I like study English very much. Communicating with people from different countries definitly widen my vision.</li>
                  <li>Hiking with friends is super cool.</li>
